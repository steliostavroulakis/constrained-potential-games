# Constrained Potential Games 

This repository includes the code for the experimental section of the paper entitled: "Computing Nash Equilibria in Potential Games with Private
Uncoupled Constraints" in the form of google colab notebooks.

## What is included:

* **Experimental findings** presented in the paper, use the notebook to follow along and run the cells.
* **Hyperparameter-sweeps**
* **Interactive demo** showcasing players minimizing congestion while adhering to private constraints.
